			<h4>"Confusion is your friend!"</h4>

				<div class="main-container">
					<div id="first-third">
					<p>You often learn more when you've had to work harder to get there. My struggle with a broken image ref and a night of frustration now means I can insert images and links like nobody's business.</p>
					</div>

					<div id="second-third">	
					<p>Why? Because my mistake was simply a typo but I spent hours learning every which way to properly work with images</p>
					</div>

					<div id="third-third">
					<p>Part II of my advice is to always take breaks! I went to sleep frustrated, went back into troubleshooting mode the next night &mdash; my mistake was immediately clear. I had a typo in my image name that I couldn't see for staring at the same line of code all night. Stepping away from your work allows you to return later with fresh eyes.</p>
